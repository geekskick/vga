# VGA
This project is a VHDL implementation of a VGA displayer for my Zybo board. At the moment all it does it run some tests.

## Todo
[ ] Test the top model
[ ] Put it on the Zybo

## Running Tests
To test the modules when you have vivado 2018.1 installed use the following at the project root.
```bash
source run_vivado_tests.sh
```
The above will create a vivado project with the sources and test benches and run the test benches. The vivado project will remain open for browsing etc.

### Putting on the Hardware
